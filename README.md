# Patient Survival Prediction using Deep Learning
 
Deriving a quick understanding of the overall health of a patient is of paramount importance in emergency healthcare situations. Often this understanding is hindered for many different reasons.

A patient in distress or in an unresponsive state may not be able to inform the healthcare professionals about chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or other injuries. In particular, The intensive care units in the hospitals often lack verified medical history of the incoming patients. Also, when a patient shifts from one medical support provider to another, the clinical records of the patient may take days to transfer, which delays the treatment process. The pandemic situations present the health workers with these issues at a much larger scale as the hospitals may get overloaded with patients in severe conditions.

The knowledge about medical records of a patient is crucial in the treatment process. It also plays a significant role in determining his/her survival odds to a substantial extent. In this project, the goal is to predict whether a patient will survive or not, based on various relevant medical information.
